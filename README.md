**Disclaimer:** This integration is not affiliated with √Åguas de Coimbra.

This Home Assistant integration retrieves telemetry data from your water meter as published on the [√Åguas de Coimbra website](https://bdigital.aguasdecoimbra.pt/uPortal2/coimbra/index.html).

For precise and real-time water usage, consider installing a dedicated sensor. [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/water/) provides several examples.

## üíß Sensors


The integration comprises the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Unit | Description | Max. update frequency |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| `today_consumption` | Litre (L) | Today's water consumption. Sum of all the readings available for the day ‚Äî typically one per hour, but often inconsistent, with readings occurring only a few times per day. | Once per hour |
| `yesterday_consumption` | Litre (L) | Yesterday's water consumption. Sum of all readings from the previous day. | Once per day |
| `meter_reading` | Cubic meter (m¬≥) | Official meter reading from √Åguas de Coimbra. Updated once per day around midnight. Although stored as a float, the meter appears to report only the integer part. This is the value that will appear on your invoice. | Once per day |
| `billing_cycle_consumption` | Cubic meter (m¬≥) | Water consumption during the current billing cycle. | Once per hour |
| `billing_cycle_cost` | Euro (‚Ç¨)  | Cost of the billing cycle. | Once per hour |


**Notes:** 
 - To prevent abuse of the √Åguas de Coimbra portal, this integration retrieves data only once per hour and fetches only essential information.
 - The billing cycle cost shown is only an estimate. Please note that the actual amount on your invoice may differ. This may be due to variations in the billing cycle length (which can range from 28 to 30 days), inaccuracies in the calculation formula, or outdated or incorrect pricing. This estimate is provided for informational purposes only, and I cannot be held responsible for any discrepancies.
